# mpfs-hal-procmacros

This crate provides macros meant to be used with the [mpfs-hal](https://crates.io/crates/mpfs-hal) and [mpfs-hal-embassy](https://crates.io/crates/mpfs-hal-embassy) crates. It is reexported by both of these crates, and thus does not need to be explicitly depended upon.

See the [repository](https://github.com/AlexCharlton/mpfs-hal) for usage, examples, features, and other details.
